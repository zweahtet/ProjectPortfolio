Use 0 if the item does not exist.\n\nDefine the procedure pascal(row, column) which takes a row and a column, and finds the value of the item at that position in Pascal's triangle. Rows and columns are zero-indexed; that is, the first row is row 0 instead of 1 and the first column is column 0 instead of column 1.\n\nFor example, the item at row 2, column 1 in Pascal's triangle is 2.","code":"def pascal(row, column):\n    \"\"\"Returns the value of the item in Pascal's Triangle \n    whose position is specified by row and column.\n    >>> pascal(0, 0)\n    1\n    >>> pascal(0, 5)\t# Empty entry; outside of Pascal's Triangle\n    0\n    >>> pascal(3, 2)\t# Row 3 (1 3 3 1), Column 2\n    3\n    >>> pascal(4, 2)     # Row 4 (1 4 6 4 1), Column 2\n    6\n    \"\"\"\n    if column == 0:\n    \treturn 1\n    elif row == 0:\n    \treturn 0\n    else:\n    \treturn pascal(row - 1, column) + pascal(row - 1, column - 1)\n\n","course":"cs61a","url":"http://cs61a.org"},"__N_SSG":true}
